What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    manually saving depend upon us when we want to commit.so according to our logic you can save whenever you want to save.automatically saves your time but it saves even small and unnecessary changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    google uses it's own mind and git tells us to use your mind.
